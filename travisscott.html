	<img src="images/travis.jfif" class="float1">
	<p class="p1">Jacques Berman Webster II was born April 30, 1992, in Houston, Texas. He grew up in Missouri City, a middle-class suburban area bordering southwest Houston. Webster lived with his grandmother, but later moved to the suburbs, where his father ran his own business. Webster attended Elkins High School and graduated at seventeen. Webster then attended the University of Texas San Antonio, before dropping out his sophomore year to fully pursue his music career. After dropping out, Webster immediately moved to New York City in an attempt to start his music career. His parents, frustrated that he had dropped out of school, eventually cut him off financially.</p>

	<p class="p2">Scott's first solo full-length project is a mixtape titled Owl Pharaoh, which was set to be released as a free download in 2012. However, the project was delayed, and was announced to be slated for a later release. The project was later re-created by Kanye West and Mike Dean, and was then again delayed for sample clearance issues. In promotion Scott would release the track, "Blocka La Flame", a remix of fellow GOOD Music label-mate Pusha T's single "Blocka" (which features production and vocals from Scott). The song was produced by Young Chop, with additional production by Scott himself, alongside Mike Dean. On March 22, 2013, Scott released the music video for a song titled "Quintana", set to appear on Owl Pharaoh. The mixtape's version of the song features guest vocals from fellow American rapper Wale, while the production was handled by Scott himself, alongside Sak Pase and Mike Dean. On March 27, XXL revealed that Scott was a member of their Freshman Class of 2013. On March 29, 2013, following his interview with British disc jockey, DJ Semtex, Scott premiered a snippet of his commercial debut single, titled "Upper Echelon", featuring 2 Chainz and T.I. On April 2, 2013, Scott stated Owl Pharaoh was his official debut mixtape and would be released on the iTunes Store on May 21, 2013. On April 23, 2013, "Upper Echelon" was sent to urban contemporary radio. The EP was released for free download.</p>

	<p class="p4">Scott has stated that he is influenced by Bj√∂rk, Portishead, Bon Iver, Kid Cudi, M.I.A., Kanye West, Toro y Moi, Tame Impala, T.I. and Thom Yorke. Spin magazine compared his 2013 mixtape Owl Pharaoh to that of Kid Cudi's Man on the Moon II: The Legend of Mr. Rager. Scott makes heavy use of audio manipulation effects such as Auto-Tune, phasing, delays, and stereo-sculpted chorusing and harmony structures, predominantly influenced by producers Mike Dean and Alex Tumay. Scott's musical style has been described as a "blend between traditional hip-hop and lo-fi" and often characterized as "ambient"; Scott himself has said "I'm not hip-hop".</p></article>

	<p class="p5">Vulture described Scott's sound as "unremittingly dark, syncretic, hi-res, and above all unnatural. Scott has said that he is a fan of Broadway theatre and would like to do an album of show tune covers. He has said that he would like to write his own musical in future.</p></p>
